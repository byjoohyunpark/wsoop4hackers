# wsoop4hackers

This repository is used as a visual tool for Hackers performance in Todd Anderson's Performing the Internet class. This tool consists of my previous work WSOOP and Daniel Shiffman's Flocking example code. Live project can be previewed [here](https://byjoohyunpark.github.io/wsoop4hackers/).
